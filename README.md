# iu-nuxt-task-management

This is the source code of the Nuxt.js implementation for the task management case application for my bachelor's thesis "Low-Code vs. Traditional Development: A Task Management Application Case Study with Insights into AI-Assisted Coding" at the IU Internationale Hochschule.
